Data Flow

Step | Flow
  1. | User accesses the frontend application (React)
  2. | User registers/login using authentication forms
  3. | Authenticated user submits feedback via a feedback form
  4. | Frontend sends feedback data through API (Axios/Fetch) to the backend (Node.js/Express.js)
  5. | Backend validates the data and stores it into the MongoDB database
  6. | Admin dashboard fetches and displays all feedback records
  7. | Admin can manage (view/delete) feedbacks as needed
  8. | Notifications are triggered based on action success/failure.
